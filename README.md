===========

This repo is intended as an example of how github could be used for creative writing.

Add files to your repository:
1. Click the + icon next to your repository name (above the directory listing).

Add folders to your repository:
1. Click the + icon next to your repository name. Instead of creating a single file name near the top of the next page, enter the name of a new folder (or folders) and the name of a new file: "newfolder/newfile"

Use tags to mark a revision for easy reference. Tags are essentially a branch that cannot be edited, so that it's around for posterity. This way you can always see exactly what "v2.2" of your repository looked like.

Use branches to make changes to your work or try something new without altering the existing version(s).
If you like what you've done in a branch, you can merge it into other branches.
